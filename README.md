This project demonstrates an image classification using machine learning techniques applied to a raster image. The image data is processed and classified into different categories using a Random Forest classifier.

## Description

This repository contains Python code that performs raster image classification. The classification is done using the `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`. The project uses the `rasterio` library to read the image data, and `matplotlib` for visualization.

### Key Features:
- Read raster images with `rasterio`.
- Create training data by manually labeling different regions of the image.
