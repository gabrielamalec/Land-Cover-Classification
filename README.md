This project demonstrates an image classification using machine learning techniques applied to a raster image. The image data is processed and classified into different categories using a Random Forest classifier.

## Description

This repository contains Python code that performs raster image classification. The classification is done using the `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`. The project uses the `rasterio` library to read the image data, and `matplotlib` for visualization.

### Key Features:
- Read raster images with `rasterio`.
- Create training data by manually labeling different regions of the image. <br>

- Train a Random Forest model to classify the raster image. <br>

  We checked the accuracy and improved it by providing more precise square areas for labeling. Initially, the accuracy was 0.756, but after refining the labeled areas, the accuracy increased to 0.839.
- Visualize the classification results. <br>

### Selection of Training Fields for Classification

In this project, we manually defined the training fields by labeling specific regions of the image. We labeled three regions as follows:

    Class 1 (Buildings): Region (1100:1200, 1100:1200)
    Class 2 (Crops): Region (700:800, 900:1000)
    Class 3 (Forest): Region (600:700, 50:150)

We visualized these regions to confirm the correctness of the labeling. Next, we reshaped the image data, and flattened the labels for model training. We applied a mask to exclude pixels that are not labeled, ensuring we only use relevant data. We then split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). Afterward, we trained a Random Forest classifier on the training data, evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy, and displayed the resulting classified image.
